**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

To me, the most interesting topic covered so far in the domain is the fabrication process for the chips/die. While we have only briefly covered this topic in the domain, I have some prior internship experience at a semi-conductor company that exposed me to some of the process behind the fabrication aspect of the domain. The methods used to fit complex designs on such small spaces with such high precision are really interesting to me.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

One potential investigation I would like to pursue in Quarter 2 is further research into the specific ways that the physical location data could be used as an effective feature within the current state of the art models for congestion prediction. While reading through the paper we aim to reimplement this quarter, I noticed that they had done some brief research into this feature resulting in a roughly 10% performance increase. The paper explained that this look into positional data was only brief and didn't end up being used in the final model. I would like to further explore this seeing as it has shown some promising performance bonuses and the authors explained they would like to look further into it. 

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

One potential change I would make to the approach we've taken so far in our Quarter 1 Project would be to expand Assignemtn 1 of our project to include modeling. Our first assignment involved introducing us to graph data on a dataset that was easy to interact with and familiar conceptually. This introduction included performing various analyses on the data. Since Assignment 2 involves us reimplementing a complex graph based machine learning model, I would have liked to get some experience building a simple model on simple graph representation data.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

In class, we briefly discussed using text based methods to predict congestion from the code used to design chips. I thought that this was a really interesting approach to potentially prediciting congestion in chip design. It would be fun and interesting to see how a text based model would perform versus the graph based models. It would, however, be a challenge to obtain data to make this exploration possible since we are provided with a strong dataset for graph based approaches.
